  "system_prompt": "You are the Empathy Scale Generation Agent. Your job is to design a structured, theoretically consistent empathy scale for human–robot collaboration. STRICTLY: 1) Follow expert templates as baseline (dimensions, item phrasing, anchors); 2) Adapt to the specific scenario from interview and literature; 3) Maintain clarity, concise items, and alignment to measurement theory; 4) Provide comprehensive design rationales with theoretical/empirical basis and citations; 5) Keep output as a clean, review-ready Markdown document; 6) Include item-level design rationales explaining theoretical basis and relevance to empathy measurement in human–robot collaboration; 7) Ensure traceability: every modification must have a rationale or source reference; 8) CRITICAL: Every adaptation (addition, deletion, or adjustment) must be explicitly traceable to at least one verifiable local PDF source - prefer well-recognized or high-impact literature when available; 9) All references must include full author names, publication titles, and years.",
  "generation_prompt": "Context for scale adaptation:\n\nAssessment Context: {assessment_context}\nRobot Platform: {robot_platform}\nInteraction Modalities: {interaction_modalities}\nCollaboration Pattern: {collaboration_pattern}\nEnvironmental Setting: {environmental_setting}\nAssessment Goals: {assessment_goals}\nExpected Empathy Forms: {expected_empathy_forms}\nMeasurement Requirements: {measurement_requirements}\n\nLiterature Findings (organized):\n{literature_overview}\n\nSample of Downloaded Papers (brief):\n{literature_samples}\n\nDetailed References from Local PDFs (use these for citations):\n{literature_references}\n\nExpert Reference PDFs available (templates/guidelines): {expert_pdf_names}\n\nTASK: Generate a review-ready empathy scale draft following this process:\n\n1. Generate Initial Scale Items:\n   - Follow structure, examples, and phrasing conventions from expert reference PDFs\n   - Generate item statements for major dimensions (e.g., Cognitive, Affective, Behavioral empathy)\n   - For each dimension and item, prepare a design rationale explaining:\n     * The theoretical or empirical basis of the dimension/item\n     * Why it is relevant to empathy measurement in human–robot collaboration\n     * Supporting evidence from literature or expert sources\n\n2. Adapt Using Contextual Information (REFERENCE-FOCUSED):\n   - ACTIVELY USE papers gathered by Literature Search Agent Group - review ALL available papers in the Detailed References list\n   - Incorporate findings from Interview Agent Group (scenario details, interaction modalities, user expectations)\n   - Incorporate findings from Literature Search Agent Group (related PDFs, theories, validated items)\n   - For adaptations, ACTIVELY SEARCH through and USE multiple relevant papers from the literature search (not just expert PDFs)\n   - Draw upon papers from different categories (behaviors, measurement, definitions) to inform your adaptations\n   - Adapt items accordingly:\n     * Modify wording to reflect scenario context or robot embodiment\n     * Add items if new empathy aspects emerge\n     * Remove redundant or non-applicable items\n   - CRITICAL: For EVERY adaptation (addition, deletion, or adjustment):\n     * Actively reference papers from the literature search - use multiple sources, not just expert PDFs\n     * Explicitly identify which local PDF source(s) support this adaptation\n     * Cite using full author names, publication title, and year from the Detailed References provided\n     * Prefer well-recognized or high-impact literature when multiple sources are available\n     * Ensure the source can be verified in the local PDF files\n   - IMPORTANT: Make extensive use of the literature search papers - they were specifically gathered to support scale adaptation\n\nKey Principles:\n- Always preserve conceptual validity from expert sources\n- Ensure contextual alignment with interview and literature insights\n- Maintain traceability: EVERY modification must be traceable to at least one verifiable local PDF source\n- Source reliability: Prioritize well-recognized or high-impact literature when available\n- Citation format: Use full author names, publication titles, and years (e.g., Smith et al. (2023) found that... or (Smith, Jones, & Brown, 2023))\n- Use the Detailed References provided above - do not invent or fabricate citations\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown):\n# Empathy Scale (Draft)\n\n## Purpose and Context (2-3 sentences)\n- Briefly state scenario and intended use.\n\n## Structure\n- Dimensions/Subscales: list and 1-line definition each.\n- Response Format: Likert anchors and scale range (e.g., 1–5).\n- Administration Notes: who rates, when, and guidance.\n\n## Items by Dimension\n### Dimension A: <name>\n- Item 1: [statement]\n- Item 2: [statement]\n- Item 3: [statement]\n  ...\n\n### Dimension B: <name>\n- Item 1: [statement]\n- Item 2: [statement]\n  ...\n\n(Repeat for all dimensions. Aim ~3–6 items per dimension.)\n\n## Scoring\n- Scoring rules, reverse-coded items, subscale totals, overall score.\n\n## Design Rationale\n\nThis section must provide comprehensive justification for all design decisions, organized as follows:\n\n### Theoretical Framework and Dimension Selection\n- Explain the theoretical or empirical basis for chosen dimensions/subscales\n- Describe how dimensions map to established empathy scales and frameworks\n- Cite relevant sources from literature and expert PDFs\n- Explain why these dimensions are relevant to empathy measurement in human–robot collaboration\n- For each dimension, provide:\n  * Theoretical foundation (e.g., based on cognitive/affective/behavioral empathy frameworks)\n  * Empirical evidence supporting its importance (cite studies)\n  * Relevance to the specific collaboration scenario\n\n### Item Design and Phrasing Rationale\n- For each dimension, explain:\n  * Why specific items were chosen or developed\n  * Theoretical or empirical basis for each item (cite sources)\n  * How item phrasing reflects empathy measurement in human–robot collaboration\n  * How items were adapted for the specific scenario (robot platform, interaction modalities, collaboration pattern)\n  * How wording choices accommodate the interaction context (e.g., text/voice, embodied/non-embodied)\n- Cite sources that support item construction principles\n\n### Response Format Justification\n- Explain the choice of scale points (e.g., 5-point vs 7-point Likert)\n- Justify anchor labels and their appropriateness\n- Cite studies or expert sources that support the chosen format\n- Explain how the format aligns with measurement best practices\n\n### Adaptation Rationale\n- For modifications from expert templates:\n  * Explain what was changed and why\n  * For EACH modification, explicitly identify the supporting local PDF source(s) with full citations (author names, title, year)\n  * Cite supporting evidence for each modification using references from the Detailed References list\n  * Explain how modifications preserve conceptual validity while improving contextual fit\n  * Trace each modification to its verifiable source (interview insights → cite if documented, literature findings → cite PDF, expert guidance → cite expert PDF)\n  * If a modification combines multiple sources, cite all relevant sources\n  * Example format: Item X was adapted to focus on text-based interaction based on findings from Smith et al. (2023) who demonstrated relevant findings\n\n## Brief Rationales for Modifications\n- Bullet list with 1–2 sentence rationale per major modification (can reference Design Rationale section for details).\n\n## Notes for Validation\n- Short suggestions for pilot testing, reliability, and validity checks.\n\n## References\n- List ALL works that were directly cited or significantly used during scale development\n- Format each reference on its own line with: Author names (Last, First Initial.), Publication Year. Full Title. [If available: Journal/Conference, Volume/Pages]\n- Include full author names when available; if authors are unknown, use title and year only\n- Include sources from the Detailed References list that were:\n  * Directly cited in the Design Rationale section\n  * Significantly used to inform adaptations and modifications\n  * Referenced for theoretical frameworks or item design\n  * Used for response format decisions\n- Include both literature search papers (from local PDFs) and expert PDFs\n- List references line by line (one per line) in a clear, readable format\n- Example format: Smith, J., Jones, M., & Brown, A. (2023). Title of the Paper. Conference Name.\n- Verify that each reference can be found in the local PDF files provided\n- IMPORTANT: Make sure to include papers from literature search that were actively used for adaptations - do not just list expert PDFs",
