# Literature Search Agent Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The literature search agent has been comprehensively enhanced to prioritize two equally important goals and enable more thorough literature retrieval.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Dual Priority Focus** (Equal Emphasis)

The agent now explicitly focuses on TWO EQUAL priorities:
- **Priority 1**: Understanding how to CONSTRUCT PERCEIVED ROBOT EMPATHY SCALES
  - Methods, frameworks, and validation approaches
  - Psychometric validation and scale development
- **Priority 2**: Understanding how ROBOT EMPATHY is understood in collaboration scenarios
  - Theoretical foundations
  - Behavioral manifestations
  - Contextual factors

### 2. **Comprehensive Literature Retrieval**

The agent now:
- Generates **5-6 search queries** (increased from 3)
- Searches **20 papers per source per query** (increased from 15)
- Screens **80 papers** for relevance (increased from 40)
- Downloads up to **50 papers** (increased from 30)
- Extracts findings from **50 papers** (increased from 30)

### 3. **Lowered Relevance Threshold**

- Changed from `score >= 4` to `score >= 3` for more inclusive screening
- Now accepts "potentially relevant" papers (score 3) that may indirectly inform scale design
- More proactive exploration of related research

### 4. **Expanded Search Scope**

The agent now searches across multiple domains:
- Robotics and human-robot interaction
- Psychology of human-robot emotional interaction
- Affective computing and emotional AI
- Psychometrics and scale validation
- Cross-disciplinary research with potential relevance

### 5. **Updated Prompts**

**System Prompt**: Now emphasizes TWO EQUAL priorities and comprehensive exploration

**Query Generation**: 
- Generates 5-6 comprehensive queries
- Covers scale construction, robot empathy understanding, interdisciplinary research
- Both direct and indirect relevance

**Relevance Screening**:
- Explicitly includes papers about scale construction
- Includes papers about robot empathy understanding
- Accepts score 3+ (potentially relevant)
- Only excludes purely human-to-human empathy

**Fallback Queries**: Expanded with additional query types
- Added "scale_construction" queries
- Added "interdisciplinary" queries
- More comprehensive fallback coverage

## Technical Details

### Search Parameters
- **Max queries**: 5-6 (was 3)
- **Papers per source**: 20 (was 15)
- **Screening threshold**: 80 papers (was 40)
- **Extraction limit**: 50 papers (was 30)
- **Download limit**: 50 papers (was 30)
- **Relevance score**: >= 3 (was >= 4)

### Progress Logging
- Shows every 10th paper being screened (was every 5th)
- Displays comprehensive coverage statistics

## Expected Outcomes

The enhanced agent will:
1. Retrieve a more comprehensive set of literature (50+ papers vs 30)
2. Include both directly relevant AND potentially relevant papers
3. Focus equally on scale construction methods AND understanding robot empathy
4. Explore interdisciplinary research across multiple domains
5. Provide a broader knowledge base for designing perceived robot empathy scales
